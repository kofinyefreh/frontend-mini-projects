# Frontend Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Frontend Mini Projects Collection** — a personal portfolio of small, focused frontend projects built to strengthen my web development skills and demonstrate practical UI/UX implementation.

Each project in this repository is **self-contained**, showcasing specific frontend concepts such as animations, API integration, responsive design, DOM manipulation, and component-based architecture (using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **learning space** to explore frontend development fundamentals.
- A **portfolio** to showcase my ability to build functional and visually appealing UIs.
- A **reference hub** for reusable design patterns and logic.

Would you like me to tailor the README to include **a progress tracking section** (like a checklist of completed and upcoming projects)? That’s great for GitHub visibility and self-tracking.
